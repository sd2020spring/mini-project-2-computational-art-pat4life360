Software Design Mini Project 5
Here,we have a 3D car racing game, in which you have to drive your selected car through obstacles, and on the road in order to complete the track.
The goal of this game is to beat all 6 stages to unlock the last car.
Each stage of this racing game is a track, that a car that completes 3 rounds through a selected track chosen in the menu. 
FOr car choices, we have an option of the fastest car, but low durability, a medium speed car with medium durabiility, and a low speed car with high durability, and your objective is to complete the stage without your car getting destroyed.
There are laserbeams coming overhead which enact damage to your car if it comes in contact. We have horns as icons, which signify the number of stages you have completed. A golden horn means you have completed the stage.
In order to reset number of horns, simply press "R" in the menu. 
In the folder, if you navigate to data>gamedata.txt, you will see 6 "1"s, which represent the horns which have been completed. Changing them to 0, changes it to uncompleted.
You also have differnet background music for each of the stages, as well as a HUD and stage completion idicator, giving you all the information you need to finish the stage.
